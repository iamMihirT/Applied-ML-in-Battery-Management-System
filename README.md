By using machine learning and deep learning techniques one can make use of historical data for predicting certain important parameters of a battery or a battery pack. This type of parameters can include temperature, SOC, Current, Voltage etc. After predicting the future values of these parameters using time series analysis one can give Electric Vehicle Owner the signal to take a precaution once we can sense the abnormality in the data.

DataSet Description:-
A comprehensive vehicle model that included the powertrain and the heating circuit was validated using data from 72 actual driving excursions with a BMW i3 (60 Ah).  
 	
Each journey includes: 
•	The environment (temperature, elevation, etc.)\
•	Car information (speed, throttle, etc.) \
•	Battery data (voltage, current, temperature, SoC) 
•	Data for a heating circuit (indoor temperature, heating power, etc.) 

Models Used:-
Base Model :-  Regression \
Main Model :- Long Short Term Memory
